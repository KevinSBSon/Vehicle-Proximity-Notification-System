# Vehicle-Proximity-Notification-System
Detect only cars nearby and warn those cars to the driver by drawing red boxes on them. <br> Designed to support drivers in the driving environment at high speed with many cars, such as racing, track driving, and driving on the highway.
<br>
- Detect objects from a realtime video and Classify them in proximity with pre-trained YOLO model
- Process a real time video with OpenCV and Predict each object in an image of frame through a CNN by implementing non-max suppression with IoU(Intersection over Union)
